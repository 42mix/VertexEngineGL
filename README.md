An OpenGL based game engine, currently in early development.

## Why another game engine?
This project is mainly for learning purposes.  This fork aims to get OpenGL working on [VertexEngine](https://github.com/VertexEngine/VertexEngine/blob/master/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) completely.

## Build
Run the build scripts from within the `scripts` directory. Or run
```
$ cmake [dir] && make
```
